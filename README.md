# Phases of the Moon
Project 1 for Group 4.
A lunar calendar that will allow you to search for your current city, conver that into latitude and longitude to provide you with the current moon phase and weather data so you can understand the visual possibilites of the moon.
The calendar will also let you see the current month's lunar cycle upon loading, but then search through Days, Months, and years to see future or past lunar cycles.

## User Story
As a moon photographer
I want to view a calendar that has information about weather and moon phase for that day
So that I can get the best picture of the moon in a particular phase with clear conditions

## What problems will the app solve?
The user will be able to open the app to see weather conditions for a searched city that could possibly hinder their desired outcome. They are also able to see the current moon phases to help decide if conditions are optimal.
